Considerations:

1. You need FreeCAD to open files with FCStd extension. I recommend 0.18 version or higher.
2. The model is a version based on original drawings and structural proposal by Le Corbusier (including detail view of concrete blocks in the slabs). And a model in display at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag in the Netherlands (see picture in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom-Ino_House ).
2. This is a work in progress. Changes and updates are expected.
